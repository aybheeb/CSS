/* 
Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied when multiple rules target the same element.
- The `p` selector is a type selector (specificity: 0,0,0,1).
- The `.styled-with-class` selector is a class selector (specificity: 0,0,1,0).
- The `#styled-with-id` selector is an ID selector (specificity: 0,1,0,0).

The selector with the highest specificity takes precedence:
- ID selectors (`#styled-with-id`) override class selectors and type selectors.
- Class selectors (`.styled-with-class`) override type selectors.
- Type selectors (`p`) have the lowest specificity.

Therefore, if a paragraph has an ID of `styled-with-id`, it will be green. If it has the class `styled-with-class` but no ID, it will be blue. Otherwise, all other paragraphs will be red.
